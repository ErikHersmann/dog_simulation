# Simulating this stuff

- 4 Spots before the start for 4-6 players (let's assume 4 for the sake of the argument here)
- 15 Spots (including the start of the next player, excluding your own start) and then 4 spots as safe spots connected to the start
- 110 cards 6x joker, 8x other cards
- 6x Joker(?) + 8x Start13 (13/Starter) + 8x Start11 (1/11/Starter) + 8x Four (Forwards/Backwards) + 8x Teleport + 8x Seven (Split up exactly 7 points and capture all skipped tokens) = 46 cards
- 2/3/5/6/8/9/10/12 (8 cards)x8 = 64 cards + 46 cards = 110cards

## Issues

- class for cards
- team play
- shuffle cards (read up on rules)
- win conditions (ruor)
- strategies definition for simulation
- forced moves (ruor)
- forced discard (ruor)
- trading cards pre round

## Feature ideas

- extended board
- generalize to n players
- generalize to non-team

## Roadmap

- Finish board setup
    - Cards
    - Initial setup
- Finish random strategy
- Finish win conditions
- Finish full simulation run and verify manually from visualization
